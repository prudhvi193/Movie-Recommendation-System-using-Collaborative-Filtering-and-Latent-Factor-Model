# Movie Recommendation System implemented using Collaborative Filtering and Latent Factor Models

Authors: Prudhviraj Sheela, Aman Masipeddi

The main motive of this project is to develop a movie based recommender system using two methods. They are:

a)Item-Item Collaborative Filtering

b)Latent Factor Model using Stochastic Gradient Descent

In the models that are developed we evaluate the Root Mean Sqaure Error (RMSE) score for measuring the performances.
